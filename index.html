  Coding Exercise.

  This is a FIFO problem. We have products arriving based on supply, and then sent to customers based on demand.

  Demand is items going out to the customers.
  Supply is items coming in from the vendors

  We need to match the two. I have a long description below, but that is essentially all we’re looking for.

  I’ve chosen this because it’s not a standard coding exercise that he will be able to Google the solution for.

  The idea is to see if the candidate can understand the business problem, and can write a solution with readable
  concise
  code.
